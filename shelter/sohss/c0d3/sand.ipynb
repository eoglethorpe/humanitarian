The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)-Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) estimates that 10,074,699 people were living in regions that were exposed to wind speeds of 120 km/h or more, and that some districts near Cox’s Bazaar and Chittagong were hit with gusts that topped 130 km/h. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere were at least six lives lost, as well as 136 people injured, according to the National Health Crisis Management Centre and Control Room of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Government sources have estimated that approximately 52,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 260,000 people in possible need of shelter. In particular, Cox’s Bazaar district was heavily hit, with approximately 17,000 residences damaged. Housing for undocumented Myanmar nationals near Cox’s Bazaar was severely damaged.

The most severely affected area has been Cox’s Bazar, where more than 300,000 Rohingya refugees and Undocumented Myanmar Nationals are residing. Six Rohingya settlements in the area have reportedly been severely affected, with up to 70 per cent of shelters as well as latrines, clinics and other infrastructure damaged. Agencies working in Cox’s Bazar and other affected areas, are providing assistance in support of the Government response.

These facilities had been supporting 13,437 children in makeshift settlements and host communities. According to UNICEF, children are at risk of exploitation, abuse and violation, as they are taking shelter with people who are not their immediate family members. Caregivers are busy collecting relief and restoring livelihoods; as a result, children are often left unattended for long periods. This could increase their vulnerability and exposure to risks.

However, initial results from Myanmar Red Cross Society rapid assessments, conducted 30 and 31 May, indicated that the storm impacted 12 of 17 townships in Rakhine State. The initial figures showed that 3,517 houses were partially damaged while 967 houses were completely damaged in Maungdaw township. 823 houses were damaged in Sittwe, Minbya and Rathedaung townships. A significant number of longhouses and other infrastructure, including latrines and temporary learning spaces, have been destroyed or severely damaged in existing IDP camps in Sittwe and Pauktaw townships.

As of 2 June, the Government reported that over 4,600 houses were destroyed and 11,700 houses damaged. The most severely affected areas are in the northern part of Rakhine State. In the IDP camps in central Rakhine State, hundreds of shelters, temporary learning spaces and latrines also suffered damage or collapsed due to the strong winds.

In particular, Cox’s Bazaar district was heavily hit, with approximately 17,000 residences damaged. Housing for undocumented Myanmar nationals near Cox’s Bazaar was severely damaged. Rohingya refugees are currently without reliable shelter, food, and fuel. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2055354\">UN RC, 31 May 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>An estimated 3.3 million people have been affected by Tropical Cyclone MORA, which made landfall in Chittagong Division on 30 May...As of 3 June, 540,000 people are estimated to require humanitarian assistance. The most severely affected area has been Cox’s Bazar, where more than 300,000 Rohingya refugees and Undocumented Myanmar Nationals are residing. Six Rohingya settlements in the area have reportedly been severely affected, with up to 70 per cent of shelters as well as latrines, clinics and other infrastructure damaged. Agencies working in Cox’s Bazar and other affected areas, are providing assistance in support of the Government response. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2060694\">OCHA, 5 Jun 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>The storm damaged all UNICEF-supported Child Friendly Spaces in Cox&#39;s Bazar. These facilities had been supporting 13,437 children in makeshift settlements and host communities. According to UNICEF, children are at risk of exploitation, abuse and violation, as they are taking shelter with people who are not their immediate family members. Caregivers are busy collecting relief and restoring livelihoods; as a result, children are often left unattended for long periods. This could increase their vulnerability and exposure to risks. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2086224/\">UNICEF, 20 Jun 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>According to data made available by the Government of Bangladesh, some 52,000 houses have been damaged or destroyed, leaving more than 200,000 people displaced. The worst-hit area is Cox’s Bazar district. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2108974\">ECHO, 6 Jul 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>In <strong>Myanmar</strong>, TC Mora affected the state of Rakhine, particularly Northern Rakhine. The estimate for total number of people affected by the cyclone in Myanmar is not yet available. However, initial results from Myanmar Red Cross Society rapid assessments, conducted 30 and 31 May, indicated that the storm impacted 12 of 17 townships in Rakhine State. The initial figures showed that 3,517 houses were partially damaged while 967 houses were completely damaged in Maungdaw township. 823 houses were damaged in Sittwe, Minbya and Rathedaung townships. A significant number of longhouses and other infrastructure, including latrines and temporary learning spaces, have been destroyed or severely damaged in existing IDP camps in Sittwe and Pauktaw townships. The most urgent needs identified are food, clean drinking water and other forms of basic assistance, including tarpaulins. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2055564\">IFRC, 1 Jun 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>The Government of Myanmar and international and national humanitarian partners are conducting assessments and responding to needs following Tropical Cyclone MORA. As of 2 June, the Government reported that over 4,600 houses were destroyed and 11,700 houses damaged. The most severely affected areas are in the northern part of Rakhine State. In the IDP camps in central Rakhine State, hundreds of shelters, temporary learning spaces and latrines also suffered damage or collapsed due to the strong winds. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2060694\">OCHA, 5 Jun 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>As of 13 June, official estimates for the total number of people affected in Myanmar were not yet available. Complicating the issue are the decades of protracted tension and communal violence in Rakhine state, where the cyclone hit. Access to some areas, including by humanitarian organizations, remains constricted. Although authorities have allowed some organizations to conduct needs assessments in Maungdaw and Buthidaung, the data is still to be verified and a comprehensive assessment has not been conducted, according to the IFRC. As of 13 June, distribution of NFIs had not yet started in these townships; authorities continued to invoke security concerns to postpone access. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2072694/\">IFRC, 13 Jun 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>According to assessments, the cyclone damaged close to 50,000 structures in the northern part of Rakhine State, including more than 21,000 houses and shelters for internally displaced people and more than 26,000 sanitation facilities. (<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/node/2108974\">ECHO, 6 Jul 2017</a>)</p>\\n\\n<p>In Maungdaw District, an inter-agency rapid damage and needs assessment conducted from 31 May to 6 June indicated that there are a total 21,504 houses that were damaged; the government’s assessment indicated that a total of 14,990 houses were damaged.
