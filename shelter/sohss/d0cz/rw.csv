Although several significant precipitation events during late spring helped alleviate dryness across the country, late rainfall was not sufficient to mitigate seasonal dryness in many parts of the country, which is most severe in the northwest but also significant across much of the north, northeast, southwest and central provinces.

As of 15 May, the volcanic activity has decreased with reduced ashfall experienced during first two weeks of May. The ash has, however, increased the risk of landslides, two of which were triggered by heavy rain and destroyed all houses in two communities. Residents in the most ash-affected communities have been evacuated to designated safe zones. Some 112 families (469 persons) from southern Ambae have sought refuge in 10 host communities in the east, whilst 757 families (3,055 persons) from the northern communities are temporarily sheltering in Saint Patrick’s College and Torgil Training Center in the northeast. An undetermined number have voluntarily relocated to Santo, Efate and other nearby islands ([UNICEF, 15 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2603094)).

Significant impact of ashes and gases emission to villages at Ambae started in March, when the Volcanic Alert level was raised to Level 3. Observations of the current activity are consistent with the Alert Level 2 activity.

Following a 7.5 magnitude earthquake which hit the Highlands Region of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and affected an estimated 544,000 people in five provinces, assessment teams visited 38 displacement sites in the Hela, Southern Highlands and Western Provinces of PNG between 10–27 March 2018. Data was collected from key informants including councilors, village leaders, church leaders, teachers and healthcare workers. 

The assessments showed that the most urgent needs of the displaced populations were water and shelter first and foremost, as well as kitchen utensils and food. Displacement sites such as Lau, Timu and Levani located in Hela Province are extremely isolated and were identified to be in urgent need of food rations following the destruction of food gardens and the limited food supply available. Many of the affected populations also suffer from continued trauma as aftershocks of the earthquake continue to hit the region. [(IOM, 20 Apr 2018)](https://reliefweb.int/node/2581669)

The key social infrastructure assessment, primarily focusing on health and education facilities, concluded that total estimated cost of rehabilitating in Hela, Southern Highlands and Western provinces is approximately USD 105 million. Result of a mobile Vulnerability Assessment Mapping (mVAM) survey, conducted during 22 March to 12 April 2018, indicated that 14 per cent of 1,534 households contacted in affected areas were displaced.  Nine of 31 households in Local Level Governments (LLGs) surveyed experienced high or extreme food shortages, with the destruction of food gardens in these areas removing the main livelihood and food supply source for the majority of people. [(Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 7 May 2018)](https://reliefweb.int/node/2592644)

of which 1,672 households are staying in eleven care centres while 10,089 households are staying with host communities according to the latest figures available from the Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM). Due to restricted humanitarian access, an operational planning group for land-based relief activities in Hela province was established on 16 May. The group is working closely with the PNG Government to identify down-scaled permissible locations based on latest information of the security situation in Hela province. Land-based relief operations in Hela are expected to resume incrementally from early June. [(Govt. PNG, OCHA & UN CT PNG, 28 May 2018)](https://reliefweb.int/node/2626109)

The access to remote locations and communication remains a significant challenge faced by all actors. As violent clashes in some communities are frequent, the restriction of movement has delayed, or prevented, aid from reaching certain locations. As of 29 May, humanitarian organizations temporarily have suspended operations in Hela province due to several security incidents.  Serious security concerns in some areas continue to hamper intervention. ([IFRC, 29 May 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2626804)).

With this situation, flying rocks and volcanic gas will affect the Red Zone which is about 6.5km radius around the volcano's crater. Villages located further from the volcano's centre can expect unusual volcanic hazards and ash falls around the island especially in villages exposed to prevailing trade winds direction. Acid rain may also be expected which may damage garden crops. VMGD has advised that the activity may increase, or decrease, at any time without warning. Evacuations have begun for people living in high risk areas. The Vanuatu government has requested that partner agencies be ready to support the response in the coming days.

The provincial government authorities are currently evacuating people in high-risk areas – as of 24 September, 3,000 people had been moved to safer areas on the island. As of 25 September evening, Penama provincial authorities had a record of approximately 6,800 people in evacuation centres on Ambae with an additional 900 people who have yet to be evacuated. Host communities and provincial authorities are currently supporting evacuee needs. The Provincial Disaster Committee is currently leading the response on the ground. The National Disaster Management Office advises that further evacuations are likely to occur if the situation escalates. ([IFRC, 26 Sep 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2240594))   

The volcanic eruption at Ambae is continuing but remains stable and confined to Lake Voui. Further scientific analyses confirm that there is currently no evidence of escalation of the activity. As a consequence, the Volcanic Alert Level is lowered to Level 3 from Level 4. The volcanic eruption is likely to continue in a steady state. Danger is restricted to the danger zone that extends 3 km from the active vent in Lake Voui. ([Vanuatu Meteorology & GeoHazards Department, 6 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2259504))

On Monday, 27 November the Ministry of Health of Madagascar officially announced the containment of the acute urban pneumonic plague outbreak. However, because plague is endemic in Madagascar and the plague season lasts from September to April, more cases of bubonic and sporadic pneumonic plague are expected to be reported until April 2018. ([WHO, 04 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2358099/))

By the end of April 2018, some 2,671 cases of the plague had been recorded since the first case of the plague season was reported in August 2017, including at least 239 deaths. Although the plague is endemic in Madagascar, the number of cases in the 2017-2018 season is at least six times the annual average of around 400 cases, the outbreak began earlier than usual, and the predominance of pneumonic plague in urban areas this season differs from the usual trend of bubonic plague in rural areas. Since the official announcement of the containment of the urban pneumonic plague outbreak on 27 November 2017, 194 cases of plague, bubonic (60) and pneumonic (128), have been reported, including 23 deaths. The current plague season is expected to end in April 2018, with the future plague season due to start in September 2018. ([OCHA, 26 Apr 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2575454))

According to the Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology National Institute (INSIVUMEH), heavy rainfall on 18 September of 2017, caused floodings throughout Guatemala, particularly in the north-western region of the country. Floods were registered in the municipalities of San Felipe, Santa Cruz Muluá, San Martín Zapotitlán, Mazatenango’s urban centre, Colotenango’s urban centre, Calle de la Cruz, Callejón 10, Campo Borrayo, and the cantons of Icán, La otra banda and Tulula, among other areas. When the Guatemalan Red Cross Damage Analysis and Needs Assessment (DANA) teams were deployed to the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, the departmental delegate from CONRED reported that the flooding affected 629 people, forced 164 people to evacuate from their homes and 97 people to seek shelter in collective centres, damaged 68 roads and impacted 1 bridge in the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez.  

In the departments of Suchitepéquez and Retalhuleu, floods have damaged homes, crops and household goods. Around 2,016 families are affected according to local authorities.  

The flood-stricken families preferred to find their own shelter since the collective centres assigned by local authorities do not have electricity, running water, toilets, showers or kitchens, and are far away from people’s homes; the loss of bedding, clothing, blankets and the necessary tools for their livelihoods, among other items has also prompted affected people to seek their own shelter to safeguard the few belongings they still have left.    

Local authorities have declared an orange level for the departments of Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez to be able to provide emergency assistance to the affected areas, and on September 27 2017, CONRED declared Red Alert in Retalhuleu and Suchitepéquez, to provide assistance to the local emergencies.

Continuous rains have fallen in the department of Alta Verapaz for the entire month of October 2017, affecting 62 rural and urban communities in 8 municipalities due to increased water levels and the overflow of the Cahabón, Chixoy, Icbolay and Polochic Rivers.  
The heavy rains that continue to pound the area are compounded by the presence of an easterly wave, the arrival of Tropical Storm Selma, increased humidity saturation levels and swollen rivers that threaten to impact further already flooded areas. As of 31 October 2017, 13 collective centres have been opened to house more than 999 people, whose homes were directly affected.  
Alta Verapaz is one of the largest maize producers in Guatemala, accounting for 10 per cent of the total production in the country; however, crops are being lost to the flooding, which puts small and medium-sized farmers’ food security at risk for the next few months, according to information provided by the Guatemalan Red Cross (GRC) branch in Cobán. Per official reports, 450 hectares owned by 1,097 families have been affected in the municipality of Chisec, Raxruhá and Panzós. ([IFRC, 10 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2320739/))

The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR)-Operational Satellite Applications Programme (UNOSAT) estimates that 10,074,699 people were living in regions that were exposed to wind speeds of 120 km/h or more, and that some districts near Cox’s Bazaar and Chittagong were hit with gusts that topped 130 km/h. 

There were at least six lives lost, as well as 136 people injured, according to the National Health Crisis Management Centre and Control Room of the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Government sources have estimated that approximately 52,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, leaving 260,000 people in possible need of shelter. In particular, Cox’s Bazaar district was heavily hit, with approximately 17,000 residences damaged. Housing for undocumented Myanmar nationals near Cox’s Bazaar was severely damaged.

Agencies working in Cox’s Bazar and other affected areas, are providing assistance in support of the Government response. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2060694))

The storm damaged all UNICEF-supported Child Friendly Spaces in Cox's Bazar. These facilities had been supporting 13,437 children in makeshift settlements and host communities. According to UNICEF, children are at risk of exploitation, abuse and violation, as they are taking shelter with people who are not their immediate family members. Caregivers are busy collecting relief and restoring livelihoods; as a result, children are often left unattended for long periods. This could increase their vulnerability and exposure to risks.

In **Myanmar**, TC Mora affected the state of Rakhine, particularly Northern Rakhine. The estimate for total number of people affected by the cyclone in Myanmar is not yet available. However, initial results from Myanmar Red Cross Society rapid assessments, conducted 30 and 31 May, indicated that the storm impacted 12 of 17 townships in Rakhine State. The initial figures showed that 3,517 houses were partially damaged while 967 houses were completely damaged in Maungdaw township. 823 houses were damaged in Sittwe, Minbya and Rathedaung townships. A significant number of longhouses and other infrastructure, including latrines and temporary learning spaces, have been destroyed or severely damaged in existing IDP camps in Sittwe and Pauktaw townships. The most urgent needs identified are food, clean drinking water and other forms of basic assistance, including tarpaulins. ([IFRC, 1 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2055564))

In the IDP camps in central Rakhine State, hundreds of shelters, temporary learning spaces and latrines also suffered damage or collapsed due to the strong winds. ([OCHA, 5 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2060694))

As of 13 June, official estimates for the total number of people affected in Myanmar were not yet available. Complicating the issue are the decades of protracted tension and communal violence in Rakhine state, where the cyclone hit. Access to some areas, including by humanitarian organizations, remains constricted. Although authorities have allowed some organizations to conduct needs assessments in Maungdaw and Buthidaung, the data is still to be verified and a comprehensive assessment has not been conducted, according to the IFRC. As of 13 June, distribution of NFIs had not yet started in these townships; authorities continued to invoke security concerns to postpone access.

As of October 2017, 3.9 million people were internally displaced, more than 1.3 million in Kasai. Many people are eating little more than a meal a day – typically just maize or cassava root and leaves. Crops have been destroyed, production areas and market routes cut off, huge numbers of farmers displaced and planting areas severely reduced. Crop production has been affected by pest attacks such as the Fall Armyworm, which has a ected more than 80 territories. The depreciation of the local currency has resulted in more expensive and reduced imports. This, combined with limited domestic food supplies, has pushed up cereal prices.

A fall armyworm outbreak, the first emergence of the pest in southern Africa, is causing considerable crop damage in some countries. If the pest damage aggravates, it could dampen prospects for good crop harvests that is anticipated in the current farming season. Maize, a staple food in the region, has been the most affected, as well as other cereals including sorghum, millet and wheat. Southern Africa is reeling from the effects of two consecutive years of El Niño-induced drought that affected over 40 million people, reduced food availability by 15 percent and caused a cereal deficit of 9 million tonnes.

Following the harmonization of the available data from the Early Warning and Response System (EWARS), IDP camp surveillance data from State Primary Health Care Development Agency (SPHCDA), Health sector partners and Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response (ISDR), it was concluded that there is an ongoing measles outbreak in Borno State afflicting camp and non-camp populations.

The Borno State Ministry of Health (BSMOH) is already conducting a reactive vaccination campaign with the support of partners, targeting 18 IDP camps. So far, 35,742 children have been vaccinated in six camps. This campaign however is inadequate to interrupt the transmission of measles across the state, as it does not involve the host communities nor other settlements and IDP camps where measles cases have also been reported. As the BSMOH is expanding the present campaign to include all accessible estimated 2.3 million children aged six months to 15 years in the state without prejudice to the national measles campaign, a request for support (including vaccines and logistics) have been communicated to the Federal MoH. This expanded campaign was planned to take place from 27–30 November 2016. ([Nigeria Health Cluster, 20 Nov 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1801904))

The majority of the affected population are nomadic pastoralists who have direct contact with blood or organs of the infected animals, or any other body fluid delivered from infected animals(milk). The larval mosquito bites and the blood-sucking flies (blood-feeding) can also transmit the virus. The population at risk are estimated at 124,337 so far. This number might increase due to the fact that the majority of the group at risk (pastoralists) are reluctant to seek medical assistance and are always on the move.

This will temporarily alleviate water shortages for human and animal use in some areas, but the damage done to the Maha crop is irreversible and there is continued concern for the subsequent Yala season due to the still very low water levels in reservoirs (73 major reservoirs stand at only 28% of their capacity). Based on historical trends, the combined production of staple crops foreseen from the two 2017 harvests is expected to result in the worst rice production levels in the last 10 years. ([WFP, 31 Jan 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1898859/))

Even if rainfall is received in the early months of the year, Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector is unlikely to make a full recovery in 2017. With much of the poor households concentrated in  rural areas and dependent on agriculture for access to income, and local production representing the bulk of food sources in the country, livelihood opportunities and food insecurity are only likely to worsen among the most vulnerable.

As of 3 March, an estimated 1.2 million people were affected by prolonged drought in 16 districts across Sri Lanka’s nine provinces. Kalutara District (Western Province) had the most people affected due to salinisation of the water supply.

As of 19 March, more than one million people were affected by prolonged drought in 17 out of 25 districts of Sri Lanka. According to a joint household assessment, an estimated 900,000 people were identified as being in urgent need of food assistance, with 25,000 people severely food insecure. Food, water and sanitation, health and agriculture were urgent priority needs. ([OCHA, 20 Mar 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1950309/))

As of 5 April, 900,000 drought-affected people were classed as severely food insecure. An estimated 80,000 needed immediate support to mitigate the impact of the drought and 25,000 required urgent humanitarian assistance. The loss of two consecutive harvests due to poor rainfall has impacted food security and resilience. As a consequence of the poor Maha harvest, seeds for the Yala season are “seriously compromised.” This, coupled with water shortages, could exacerbate the situation if the Yala harvest is severely impacted as expected.

Despite the southwest monsoon in late May 2017, which triggered flooding and landslides in the country’s southwest provinces, country-wide drought conditions are ongoing, with the total affected population reaching more than two million people in early September. However, the figures reported by the Disaster Management Centre have now been reduced due to brief inter-monsoonal rains experienced in mid-September across various districts. These rains are unlikely to significantly alleviate the ongoing drought conditions that are predicted to continue in the coming weeks. As of 19 September, 1,927,069 people were estimated to be affected by the drought across 17 districts, according to the Disaster Management Centre.

The outbreak of hepatitis E in the Salamat region of Chad continues to evolve, with one new district being affected. The potential of the outbreak to escalate is high given the prevailing predisposing factors. Only 25% of the 63,000 people in Am Timan, the epicenter of the outbreak, have access to clean and safe water. Meanwhile, about 30% of the 13,000 people in Aboudeïa have access to safe water. The local community continues to fetch and drink water from rain pools (ponds), sharing with animals and birds. The affected communities also have poor sanitation, commonly practicing free range open defecation. With these factors, in addition to the onset of rainy season expected soon, the risk of further spread of hepatitis E, as well as of cholera, remains very high.

([WHO, 27 May 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1559821))

Since the Federal Ministry of Health confirmed the first two AWD cases on 9 June, the number of confirmed cases are increasing. The Ethiopian Public Health Institute reported about 2,145 (nationally) and 25 (in Addis Ababa) suspected AWD cases as of 12 June 2016.

In week 15 (week ending 16 April 2017), a total of 2,388 suspected cases of AWD/cholera were reported in Afar, Amhara and Somali regions of the country. While some decline has been observed in the trend in the last weeks [4,200 cases in week 14; 4,104 cases in week 13; 4,358 cases in week 12], it is still premature to deduce overall improvement in the situation on the ground, especially with the weak surveillance system. Somali region remains the most affected, accounting for 99% of the new cases reported in the reporting week. On 20 April 2017, WHO elevated the outbreak of AWD/cholera and the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia to grade 3 emergency. This new grading enables the organization to leverage its global capacity and scale up the response to the outbreak and the humanitarian crisis.

A 27 per cent increase in the number of Acute Watery Diarrhoae (AWD) cases was reported nationwide last week, mainly due to spikes in new cases reported in Amhara and Tigray regions and a resurgence of the outbreak in Afar region where community transmission of the disease is widespread. Currently, the major risk factors for the spread of the outbreak are holy water sites where large numbers of Christian pilgrims congregate from around the country, especially in Amhara and Tigray, and seasonal mobility of daily laborers to commercial farms. The high risk for further spread of the AWD outbreak continues due to the degradation of health determinants on the back drop of overburdened local health systems, including inadequate access to safe drinking water and internal and cross-border movements.

This number is expected to rise as high as five million in 2017. The food security situation is at the most compromised level since the crisis commenced in 2013 - the combination of conflict, economic crisis and lack of adequate levels of agricultural production have eroded vulnerable households ability to cope. More than one million children under age 5 are estimated to be acutely malnourished, including more than 273,600 who are severely malnourished.

An estimated 6.01 million (50% of the population) people are expected to be severely food insecure in June-July 2017, compared to 5.5 million (45% of the population) people in May 2017. This is the greatest number of people ever to experience severe food insecurity (IPC Phases 3, 4 and 5) in South Sudan. Famine is no longer occurring in Leer and Mayendit counties, and further deterioration was prevented in Koch and Panyijiar counties of former Southern Unity State as a result of immediate and sustained multi-sector humanitarian assistance delivered to the affected population since March 2017...However, in June-July 2017, approximately 45,000 people will still be facing Humanitarian Catastrophe in Leer, Koch, Mayendit in former Unity State and Ayod County in former Jonglei state based on most likely assumptions of continued armed conflict, food shortages associated with seasonality, and humanitarian assistance delivery constraints...Of great concern is former Greater Jonglei State, where food security is rapidly deteriorating, predominantly in the counties of Ayod, Canal/Pigi, Duk, Nyirol and Uror, which are facing Emergency (IPC Phase 4) acute food insecurity, with Ayod having an estimated 20,000 people experiencing Humanitarian Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) at least through July 2017.

According to the Australia Bureau of Meteorology’s El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Outlook, there is around a 50 per cent chance (twice the normal likelihood) of an El Niño event developing in 2017. Since the beginning of 2017, sea surface temperatures have continued to warm in the Pacific. To mitigate the potential impact of El Niño, countries in the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, have started to initiate preparedness activities. In 2016, at least 11 countries across the Asia-Pacific region were affected by severe weather events associated with El Niño. While the effects of El Niño have not been consistent they have generally comprised of extended dry spells or drought leading to water shortages, prolonged lean seasons and food shortages.

According to the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme, a regional sustainable development body, five of eight surveyed models indicated El Niño is likely to form by the third quarter of 2017. The effects of an El Niño event are different for each country. Generally, however, El Niño events are usually associated with lower rainfall with the possibility of droughts, dust, and increased bushfires in countries like Fiji, New Caledonia, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu in the Western Pacific. In the Eastern Pacific, including countries like Kiribati, Nauru, Northern Cook Islands and Tuvalu, El Niño events are usually associated with higher rainfall—likely leading to flooding, infrastructure damage and the pollution of water sources.

An assessment conducted by the CNSA and WFP in December 2016 shows the number of people facing hunger and food insecurity in Grande-Anse and Sud - the most affected areas - has declined steadily from approximately 1 million to 400,000. However, in the North West, Artibonite, Nippes and La Gonave, although the impact of **Hurricane Matthew** was smaller, its effects coupled with three years of drought and severe flooding have led to a hike in the levels of food insecurity with one million people affected.

On 30 July, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, bringing strong winds and additional heavy rains to the country, which resulted in widespread flooding across 12 of the country’s 14 states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Yangon). On 31 July, the President declared Chin and Rakhine states, and Magway and Sagaing regions as natural disaster zones.

According to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), 125 people were killed and some 1.7 million people were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides. Almost all of the displaced people had returned to their villages of origin by the end of September, leaving only about 10,000 people in evacuation centres (mainly in Sagaing Region and Chin State) awaiting relocation. The Government has said it expects most of these remaining displaced people to return to their villages of origin or to be relocated by the end of October, although a portion of these people may be in temporary accommodation for longer, particularly in the case of people who are going to be permanently relocated to new sites.

The NNDMC identified Hakha in Chin State, Kale in Sagaing Region, Pwintbyu in Magway Region, and Minbya and Mrauk-U in Rakhine as the five most affected townships where a total of 229,600 people were affected by the floods. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, over 1.1 million acres of farmlands have been inundated, with more than 872,000 acres destroyed, as of 4 October. So far, 495,000 acres have since been re-cultivated. Damage to crops and arable land will disrupt the planting season and pose a risk to long-term food security.

While the water has receded in most areas, many roads and bridges were destroyed in the worst affected states and regions. The roads in Chin State were particularly badly affected and continue to pose a major logistical challenge for assessments and assistance delivery.

Multi-sectoral Initial Rapid Assessments (MIRA) were conducted in 317 locations of 34 townships in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine and Sagaing, covering close to 200,000 people. Other needs assessments were also carried out in areas not covered by the MIRA assessments in Chin and Rakhine states. According to the Rakhine State Government (RSG), Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Maungdaw and Mrauk-U townships were the most severely affected areas in Rakhine State. In many parts of Rahine State, floods and salt water severely damaged the paddy fields. A major concern remains water contamination, as most villages use water ponds for drinking water and many ponds were flooded and contaminated.([OCHA, 4 Nov 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/1248751))

Six months on from the devastating floods that struck Myanmar, around 400,000 people have received emergency assistance and support in their recovery from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. At their peak the floods affected over 9 million people across 12 of Myanmar’s 14 states and regions. The floods temporarily displaced over 1.7 million people and destroyed 15,000 homes as well as more than 840,000 acres of agricultural crops.

Between July 2015 and January 2016, over 1,400 Red Cross volunteers and staff from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross partners assisted flood affected people across the country. The first phase included evacuations, providing emergency relief such as purified water, food, household items, and shelter materials. Since then, efforts have been focused on supporting the longer term recovery of flood affected communities across the five worst hit regions of Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway and Ayerwady with livelihood activities, cleaning of contaminated ponds and wells and infrastructure rehabilitation.

As a result, some 5.6 million people in Ethiopia require emergency food assistance in 2017. In addition, 2.7 million children and pregnant and lactating mothers require supplementary feeding, 9.2 million people need support to access safe drinking water, 1.9 million households need livestock support, and 300,000 children between 6-59 months old are targeted for the treatment for severe acute malnutrition in 2017. 
Drought conditions are expected to peak during the dry December to March jilaal season, which is likely to lead to a sharper deterioration in livestock body conditions, and impacting milk production and nutrition status of the families that depend on livestock for their food and income.

Southern and eastern Ethiopia continue to battle the impact of the Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought, exacerbated by disease outbreaks, large scale loss of livelihood assets and displacement. The humanitarian situation countrywide has been further compounded by below average spring rains – the third consecutive poor/failed rains in the southern drought belt. [...] In the second half of 2017, some 8.5 million people will require emergency food assistance, some 3.6 million children and pregnant and lactating mothers will require supplementary feeding, some 10.5 million people will not have regular access to safe drinking water and some 2.25 million households will require livestock support.

Since the revision of the Humanitarian Requirements Document (HRD) in August 2017, the humanitarian context in Ethiopia has continued to evolve which has led the Government and humanitarian partners to further adjust the HRD requirements. In the food sector the needs have been revised slightly upwards to accommodate an increase in the number of beneficiaries through the inclusion of 4 million former Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) clients in the HRD. In other sectors such as health and nutrition, needs have also continued to increase mainly due to the deteriorating nutrition situation in Somali region, increase in the number of displaced people, as well as the Fall Army Worm (FAW) outbreak that continues to ravage crops throughout the country. ([Gov't of Ethiopia, OCHA, 19 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2283994))

Due to drought and large-scale displacement in the southern and south-eastern lowland areas of Ethiopia, humanitarian needs are expected to remain significant in 2018. As of September 2017, 1.3 million people, 64 per cent of whom are children, are displaced due to conflict and drought. The majority of these people will remain displaced in 2018. ([UNICEF, 4 Jan 2018](https://reliefweb.int/node/2400904))

The meher assessment findings revealed that two previous years of consecutive drought, compounded with weak rains at the end of 2017 left hundreds of thousands destitute in southern and south-eastern Ethiopia. Poor pasture regeneration and limited water source replenishment for livestock have resulted in acute humanitarian needs and will reduce traditional recovery processes among pastoralist households. Consequently, the food security situation in the lowland agro-pastoral areas is not expected to improve significantly in 2018. Overall, the good harvest in highland areas, is expected to reduce large scale needs in the northern highlands, however reduced harvest and crop loss were experienced due to erratic rainfall in some potential areas. The multi-sector humanitarian response operation established over the course of 2017 will need to be sustained in 2018. The extent of needs and the corresponding humanitarian operation will be reviewed during the belg/gu/ganna assessment in June/July.

The humanitarian situation in Somalia is rapidly deteriorating and famine is a strong possibility in 2017. This comes only six years after a devastating famine led to the death of more than a quarter of a million people – half of them children. The severe drought is a result of two consecutive seasons of poor rainfall, more in some areas. In the worst affected areas, large-scale crop failure and high levels of livestock deaths are occurring. Malnutrition and drought-related diseases are on the rise, so are displacements, including to Ethiopia. Increasing competition for resources such as water is already increasing local tensions and could trigger further inter-communal conflict. Over 6.2 million people-half the population-are in need of humanitarian assistance. The situation of children of Somalia is particularly grave.

Moreover, people under 5 years old represent more than one-quarter (195,000) of all those displaced — and are the most at risk of malnutrition and disease. ([UNHCR, 31 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2068029))

3.2 million people are severely food insecure. This situation is expected to persist throughout 2017 given the high likelihood of a third consecutive poor harvest in July. Access to food is relatively better than previously projected due to large-scale humanitarian assistance...102,263 people have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) since January. SAM admissions have increased by more than 50% since 2016. The Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU)’s post-Jilaal 2017 survey indicates a high prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition (15% to 30%) in the Bay, Bakool, Sool, Sanaag, Bari and Nugal regions, as well as in Baidoa and Mogadishu IDP camps. ([OCHA, 16 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2084594))

While the latest FSNAU assessments show a decrease of the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance from 6.7 million to 6.2 million people, the threat of localized famine countered by scaled-up humanitarian response is as relevant today as it was in the first months of this crisis. The Gu harvest will provide temporary relief for some communities in terms of food availability, but the harvest is reduced due to poor rains and access to food remains constrained. Prices will remain elevated through at least early 2018. Malnutrition, one of the leading indicators of the crisis, has reached emergency levels in a number of locations in southern and central Somalia, primarily, though not exclusively among displaced populations. Overall, some 388,000 acutely malnourished children are in need of critical nutrition support, including life-saving treatment for more than 87,000 severely malnourished children. Nearly 895,000 internally displaced people due to drought and conflict rely almost exclusively on assistance for basic services and life support. Major AWD/Cholera and measles outbreaks are also of continued concern. Through robust humanitarian assistance and the modest benefits from the underperforming Gu rains, the situation has stabilized but remains of serious concern at emergency levels. Whereas there is a modest decline in the number of people in need, there is an increase in the number of persons in the emergency-phase (IPC 4) compared to the previous assessment. When the threat of famine was announced in February, the number of people in need stood at 6.2 million. ([OCHA, 31 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2197699))

Humanitarian partners are closely following what could become another failed rainy season in a context of continued risk of famine and deteriorating humanitarian indicators. According to the October Rainfall Update for Somalia by the FAO-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM), the Deyr 2017 rainy season, which usually runs from October to December, kicked off in the last week of September in the north eastern areas and second week of October in southern and central regions. Many places in Bay, Bakool, Gedo and Middle Juba received rains at the start of the season. ([OCHA, 30 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2299179))

Food security is expected to improve for agricultural and agropastoral households in January with the Deyr harvest. In both areas, though, improvements will be short‐lived and many households will face
food consumption gaps through mid‐2018. In a worst‐case scenario of an extended absence of assistance, Famine (IPC Phase 5) remains possible, and continued large‐scale assistance is needed throughout 2018 to protect lives and livelihoods.  ([FEWSNET, 30 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2397224))

Non-farm sources of livelihoods and services affected include many small enterprises, manufacturing and processing businesses and loss of wage employment due to disruption of the economy. ([Govt, 11 Nov 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/724946))

As as the flood waters subsided, the majority of the population displaced by the floods returned to their place of origin and started recovery activities. In addition, three months on, the major immediate public health concerns related to acute respiratory illnesses, diarrhoea and skin diseases which necessitated provision of emergency health services have since dissipated. The IFRC revised its appeal down to CHF 1,097,926 to support 70,000 people for seven months, focusing on food and relief item distributions, health and hygiene promotion, emergency shelter assistance. ([IFRC, 29 Jan 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/830661))

Of the total expenditure, CHF 722,786 was spent on relief items, construction and supplies, while CHF 129,214 covered costs that enabled the delivery of assistance to beneficiaries, such as logistics, distribution and monitoring. Finally, CHF 38,663 was utilized for personnel costs (including per diem for volunteers and salaries for PRCS and IFRC staff in Islamabad supporting the operation).

By the end of August, over 600 cases had been reported, including two measles-related deaths. On 1 Sep a mass measles vaccination campaign to target all children aged 6 months to 30 years was launched. ([WHO, 1 Sep 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/698538))

The number of food insecure people more than doubled – from 1.3 million to 2.7 million. Some 357,285 children and pregnant and lactating mothers are acutely malnourished. The latest nutrition surveys showed that three sub-counties (Turkana North, North Hor (Marsabit), Mandera) had GAM rates above 30 per cent. Six sub-counties (Turkana Central, Turkana South, Turkana West, Laisamis, East Pokot (Baringo), Isiolo) had GAM rates between 15 and 29 per cent.  

Maize production in the coastal areas decreased by 99 per cent compared to the long term average. People have to travel further to access water, for example in Baringo, household walk three times longer than normal. Pastoralist communities in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties are losing their livestock - with reports of large numbers of animal deaths in Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu and Mandera counties. Data collected by UNICEF from 10 affected counties indicated that close to 175,000 children were not attending early pre-primary and primary schools, primarily due to the drought’s impact. ([OCHA, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1906393))

More than 2.6 million Kenyans were severely food insecure as of 26 May 2017 — and this number was rapidly rising. High levels of malnutrition are prevalent across the arid and semi-arid lands. Three sub-counties report Global Acute Malnutrition rates of 30 per cent, double the emergency threshold. Severe drought has dried up water resources in half of Kenya’s 47 counties and an estimated 3 million people lack access to clean water. Recurrent droughts have destroyed livelihoods, triggered local conflicts over scare resources and eroded the ability of communities to cope. Families are on the move, which poses protection risks for women and children. More than 1.2 million children are in need of education assistance. Kenya is experiencing multiple disease outbreaks including cholera/Acute Watery Diarrhea and measles. An estimated 2.9 million people require lifesaving medical interventions and community-based primary health outreach. ([OCHA, 26 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2049409))

The National Drought Management Authority’s (NDMA) early warning bulletin for June indicates that while the long rains have ended, many parts of the Arid and Semi-arid Lands (ASALs) are still experiencing long distances between home and water sources, unusually high food prices, and worrying levels of malnutrition. Being the third consecutive below-average rainfall season, the modest recovery conditions in some parts of ASALs are likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the upcoming dry season (June to September) will be a difficult one for the ASALs in terms of malnutrition and access to water and food, particularly for pastoral communities. Insecurity linked to resource-based conflicts has worsened, while Fall Armyworm and African Armyworm infestations continue to threaten crops in marginal agricultural counties, further worsening the prospects for the next harvest. ([UNICEF, 19 Jun 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2093059))

The Horn of Africa is experiencing one of the worst hunger crises in recent times due to a prolonged drought. The current drought is worse in a number of ways than in 2011, with some areas experiencing the failure of three rains in a row. In Kenya, 2.6 million people are experiencing crisis levels of food insecurity. The number could increase to 3.5 million in need of targeted assistance by August. In parts of Marsabit and Turkana, where communities are unable to reach sustained humanitarian assistance, they are at risk of sliding in to emergency levels of hunger (IPC Phase 4), one step away from famine, between July and September.

The March–May rains have been below average and it is likely that the July food harvests will also be below average, leading to a corresponding decline in access to and consumption of food. In addition, the African armyworm infestation has already affected around 69,000 hectares of farming land, prices of basic food commodities, such as maize, in Kenya have soared with overall inflation for the month of May 2017 reaching a five-year high of 11.7 per cent, and livestock prices in pastoralist areas are low due to the poor condition of animals. As a result people are reducing what they eat, with many families eating one meal a day. Food shortages are further compounded by anxiety around upcoming general elections which may politicize the crisis, a lack of access to water due to non-operational water points, and high levels of severe acute malnutrition among children below the age of five. ([OXFAM, 4 July 2017](https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/kenya-drought-crisis-call-action))

Following at least two consecutive poor rainy seasons, food security needs are expected to peak in October 2017 as food and income sources are below-average across the majority of pastoral and marginal agricultural areas. As a result, Crisis (IPC Phase 3) outcomes are expected through early December in areas of Turkana, Marsabit, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River, Samburu, and Laikipia, requiring urgent humanitarian assistance. However, an improvement to Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes is expected across all pastoral areas in early 2018; however, some of the most vulnerable households are still likely to be in Crisis (IPC Phase 3). ([FEWS, 18 Nov 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2333659/))

In Kenya, drought conditions that are expected to persist into 2018 have left 3.4 million people severely food insecure and an estimated 500,000 people without access to water. An estimated 482,882 children require treatment for acute malnutrition, including 104,614 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Eighty-eight per cent of these children are from 23 arid and semi-arid counties. Drought conditions have led to declines in school attendance and school participation and rising dropout rates.

Since 19 Sep, additional flooding has hit several districts in the country affecting 400,000 more people. Flash floods triggered by heavy rain and water from upstream hill areas across the border inundated vast areas in Bogra and Kurigram districts, while the Jamalpur town protection embankment developed a breach under pressure of rainwater. The heavy currents of flash floods gushing from Meghalaya of India have caused rapid inundation of Netrokona. Widespread flooding has also hit Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Naogaon, Brahmanbaria, and Mymensing leaving hundreds of thousands marooned, damaging houses, roads and embankments. Farmers who had replanted Aman paddy after the water started receding have lost their crops for the second time as more than 10,000 acres of crops were inundated. More than six hundred schools in the affected districts remain closed. ([IFRC, 20 Oct 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/701353))

Crop failure due to low rainfall, coupled with loss of small animals has greatly reduced the impoverished communities’ purchasing power. Poverty is endemic in the sparsely populated district with acute malnutrition rates in children as high as 20 per cent, well above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. The outbreak of sheep pox has aggravated the situation in Tharparkar, possibly having killed thousands of small animals, critical to household food security.

More than 190 children have died and 22,000 have been hospitalised in Tharparkar district in 2016 because of drought-related waterborne and viral diseases.

([Assessment Capacities Project, 16 Feb 2016](http://www.reliefweb.int/node/1396391))

According to the Joint UN Needs Assessment, several districts have been severely affected by extreme water scarcity (62% in Jamshoro and 100% in Tharparkar), and it has resulted in reduced harvest by 34-53% and livestock by 48%. ([UNICEF, 30 Jun 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1595461))

In Tharparkar District and the surrounding areas of Sindh Province, a third consecutive year of cereal production shortfalls due to drought, coupled with losses of small animals, has aggravated food insecurity and caused acute malnutrition.

Since 2013, Tharparkar has been affected by a drought‐like situation impacting livelihoods, nutrition and health conditions.

According to media reports, the incidence of under‐five deaths in Tharparkar is still on rise during the first half of 2016 with 243 deaths recorded. This may suggest a worsening health and nutrition situation following the start of the drought period. ([WFP, 19 Sep 2016](https://reliefweb.int/node/1713536))

A joint UN observation mission took place in drought-hit Tharparkar, Umerkot and Sanghar districts from 13-17 February, 2017. The resulting mission report stated that the areas remain vulnerable and that the situation may become critical or deteriorate into a 'humanitarian emergency' if little or no rain falls during the coming monsoon, and if immediate needs are not met. The mission found that the vulnerabilities outlined in an [August 2016 needs assessment](https://reliefweb.int/node/1670556/) remain, while recommendations from detailed assessments and missions conducted from 2015-2016 have not been put into practice. ([UNCT, 17 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1939704))

In the districts of Tharparkar, Umerkot and Sanghar in southeastern Sindh Province, below-average rains throughout 2016 sharply reduced the 2016/17 cereal production. This, coupled with losses of small animals due to diseases and severe shortages of fodder and water, has aggravated food insecurity and caused acute malnutrition. ([FAO, 09 May 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2024489))

Forecast models indicate that there is a 50 to 60 per cent probability of an El Niño event developing in the second half of 2017, with Pakistan categorized as a high-risk country. Worsening drought conditions could potentially affect an estimated 300,000 of the most vulnerable people — including 192,680 children — in Sindh province. There will also be an increased chance of severe monsoon rains in the north. Humanitarian partners are developing a preparedness plan aligned with priorities identified by the Government of Pakistan.

The outbreak appears to be following three major river and lake routes, suggesting that these water bodies play an important role in transmission. Towards the east of the country, the affected areas are along Lake Tanganyika and Lake Kivu and the disease appears to be moving towards Lake Albert in the north-east. In the central region, the disease is affecting areas along the internal lakes and along the Congo River, up to Kindu and Maniema.

According to WHO, no new Ebola cases have been reported since 18 Dec. The last confirmed cases were discharged on 26 Nov and 5 Dec. ([OCHA, 15 Jan 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/550282)) Uganda’s Ministry of Health and WHO declared Luwero district Ebola-free on 16 Jan 2013 ([IFRC, 5 Feb 2013](https://reliefweb.int/node/554447)).

A total of 647,536 persons were reached by the response and prevention activities performed by the URCS during the DREF operation. Despite the impressive number of persons reached, less than half of the planned beneficiaries initially planned were reached by the activities. This is largely due to a reduced number of radio spots and health messages delivered over local media and broadcasting by URCS, as other partners stepped in to cover this activity.

Moreover, the 2010-2011 crises in Cote d’Ivoire and Libya also contributed to increasing the vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of households that were deprived of the remittances of migrant workers who had fled these conflicts. Their return has also placed additional strain on their communities of return, notably in Chad, Niger and Mali. In 2012, approximately 18.7 million people were estimated to be food insecure and over one million children were at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition. ([OCHA, 17 Dec 2012](https://reliefweb.int/node/551990))

In 2012, and for the third time in ten years, the Sahel region was hit by a major drought which further weakened vulnerable communities. The scale of the resulting food and nutrition crisis required all actors to join forces to save the lives of the 24 million people affected. A [three-year regional plan](https://reliefweb.int/node/634433) was developed in 2013 aiming to deliver coordinated and integrated life-saving assistance to people affected by emergencies while shaping the response to chronic needs in nine countries: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and The Gambia. ([OCHA, 30 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2194999))

**Lake Chad Basin**: The scale of suffering remains huge and is expected to grow: around 11 million people will require assistance in 2017. Humanitarian partners have requested US$1.5 billion to provide aid to 8.2 million people. While the response strategy focuses us on providing emergency, life-saving assistance, humanitarian actors are also calling for a collaborative approach to help address the deeper causes of the Lake Chad Basin crisis that include abject poverty, the impact of climate change, rapid population growth and under-investment in social services. At the Oslo conference on 24 Feb 2017, 14 donors pledged $458 million for relief in 2017 and an additional $214 million was announced for 2018 and beyond. ([OCHA, 24 Feb 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/1917023))

**Mali**: Needs remain high with more than 3.5 million people being food insecure and some 852,000 people in need of nutrition assistance. More than 37,000 people remain internally displaced. The majority of those in need of assistance are in Mali’s northern region.
In April 2017, the Humanitarian Response Plan for 2017 for $293 million was only 11.6% funded. OCHA warned of destabilizing consequences, as the humanitarian situation is quickly deteriorating as a direct result of the conflict. ([OCHA, 28 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2008544))

Despite severe infrastructure and financial constraints, concerted Haitian and international efforts have succeeded in drastically reducing the number of reported cholera cases in Haiti – down from a peak of over 350,000 reported cases for 2011, to 21,916 reported cases for 2014, from 1 January to 30 November. The persistence of cholera in Haiti is mainly due to the lack of access to clean water and appropriate sanitation facilities, and although considerable improvements have been made in this regard, Haiti continues to host the largest cholera epidemic in the Western Hemisphere. Structural issues such as weak water, sanitation and health systems enable cholera, acute diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases to persist. ([UNCT, 31 Dec 2014](https://reliefweb.int/node/803836))

At the beginning of 2015, the number of suspected cases was 75 per cent higher than originally expected in the mid-term review of the 2014 Humanitarian Action Plan (i.e. 15,000).

Suspected cholera cases reported for January to March 2015 were above those observed in early
2012 (but lower than those reported in the first quarter of 2013). This was predominately due to
large outbreaks in the metropolitan region of Port-au-Prince which then spread to other high-risk
regions. According to the national authorities, 4,321 suspected cholera cases and 36 deaths were
reported in January, 4,055 suspected cases and 46 deaths in February ,and 3,014 cases and 22 deaths in March. ([UNCT, 31 Mar 2015](https://reliefweb.int/node/995436))

During the first two months of 2016, the cholera epidemic has had a stable development in relation to the outbreak recorded at the end of 2015. The number of cases increased slightly compared to the same period in 2015, but the trend is downward since mid February. Nevertheless the return of the rain could be an important risk factor.

As of 31 December 2016, Haitian and international efforts have succeeded in reducing the cholera cases and fatalities in Haiti by almost 88% since the peak in 2011 (350,000 cases). From 1st January to 15 April, the MSPP registered 5,095 suspected cholera cases and 69 related deaths, in comparison to the 12,536 suspected cases and 134 deaths for the same period in 2016. This downward trend, if maintained, is an opportunity to take this year a big step towards the elimination of the transmission, in case funding is available and rapid response is accordingly intensified. ([UNCT, 27 Apr 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2012344/))

According to PAH/WHO, Haiti recorded 814,551 suspected cases of cholera with 9,693 deaths between October 2010 and 31 July 2017. However, since 2016, the epidemiological situation indicates a marked decrease in the transmission of the disease. According to the MSPP / DELR figures, EPI week 23 (2017) to date is officially the period with the lowest number of suspected cases ever since the outbreak of the epidemic in 2010. This situation is more remarkable given that the rainfall accumulated in April and May 2017 was equal to or even higher than the rainfall measured during the passage of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016. ([OCHA, 17 Aug 2017](https://reliefweb.int/node/2178064))

The efforts of humanitarian partners to achieve the objective of zero cases of cholera continues with encouraging results. Thus, between January and September 2017, the country recorded a total of 10,814 suspected cases of cholera and 107 deaths against 30,211 cases and 289 deaths for the same period of 2016, a decrease of 64.2%. The highest peak in the number of cholera cases occurred in the department of Artibonite with 64.9% of the suspected cases in the month of September followed by Centre ant Ouest departments. To contain this situation, UNICEF’s partners (ACF, ACTED, Solidarités International, and French Red Cross) mobilized teams from other departments to constitute 19 teams mixed with the Rapid Response Teams (EMIRA) of the MSPP1 in the Artibonite alone. PAHO/WHO also deployed teams to outbreak areas to strengthen response either through institutional care or community activities.
However, the lack of required funding for all the components of the National Elimination Plan is a handicap and a major risk for future control of the epidemic. ([OCHA, 25 Oct 2017](https://reliefweb.int/ https://reliefweb.int/node/2308814))

In Haiti, the cases reported between EW 1 and EW 50 of 2017 (13,468) represent a decrease of 68% with respect to the cases notified since EW 1 and EW 52 of 2016 (41,421) and is the lowest reported cases since the outbreak started in Haiti in October 2010 (Figure 1). Nevertheless, there are still 200–300 suspected cases reported each week. Between EW 47 and EW 50 of 2017, suspected cases were reported in 9 of the 10 Departments, although four Departments (Artibonite, Centre, Nord-Ouest and Ouest) account for 90% of the cases. In the same period, the average number of cases reported exceeded what was reported in the preceding weeks, mainly with the increases observed in the Nord (36% increase) and Nord-Ouest (19% increase) departments.    
Similarly and comparatively between 2016 and 2017 the number of deaths reported decreased by 65% (from 447 to 157 deaths) and represents the lowest number of deaths reported since 2010.    ([WHO/PAHO, 28 Dec 2017](https://reliefweb.int/ https://reliefweb.int/node/2396014))

Nearly 70 days after Tropical Storm Agatha struck Guatemala and the Pacaya volcano erupted, some 412,000 people remain affected by the aftermath of both events. Agatha, the first tropical storm of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, made landfall on the Pacific coast of Guatemala on May 29, dumping more than 426 millimetres of rain in a short period of time and affecting 21 of the 22 departments of the country. Rainfall and damage across such a large part of the country was a phenomenon not seen since 1948. At the same time the effects of the Pacaya volcanic eruption on May 27 limited and delayed search and rescue operations as well the provision of humanitarian relief. The eruption closed the international airport, and large amounts of volcanic ash covered fields and clogged water drainage systems. This increased the flooding, rendering many roads impassable and impeding or blocking access to vulnerable populations across the country.

Preliminary results from rapid diagnostic tests in the area confirmed pneumonic plague, and the cases had clinical features compatible with this disease.The cases occurred in workers in a diamond mine in Zobia where c. 7000 people worked. The mine was re-opened on 16 Dec 2004 and the first case occurred on 20 Dec. A team from Médecins sans Frontières (Belgium and Switzerland), Medair, WHO and Ministry of Health went to the area to assess the situation([WHO,18 Feb 2005](https://reliefweb.int/node/166512))

Despite logistical problems due to dense forests in the area, the teams spent days assessing the situation in health facilities, looking for new cases and checking the situation in the mine, as well as the camp where the miners lived. They were able to organise contact tracing and provide the contacts with specific antibiotics.
